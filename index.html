                <p>In order to promote contact between students and faculty members and to raise awareness of the newest technology developments, we host competitions, seminars, and workshops. BLITZ held a number of events during the most recent session, such as seminars on "Career Trends in Computer Science", "First Steps Towards Open Source with Git/GitHub", and "Secure Coding Practices". To further assist students in becoming experts in their chosen fields, we also held a number of coding competitions. <br><br>
                In addition to these informative seminars, our yearly technical festival, BLITZKRIEG, highlights the vibrant energy and steadfast passion of our student body. Students from various backgrounds and interests come together to celebrate technology and innovation. The festival provides a broad array of programs that encourage innovation and test the sharpest minds, including both tech and non-tech ones.
